        <p>
          Hi! I am from a small town in Massachusetts, about an hour west of Boston. I love all things trees, fall weather, and hiking trails. A New Englander at heart.
          I am passionate, work hard, and enjoy solving problems. I am currently a Junior at BYU studying Information Systems. 
          Outside of school, I enjoy spending time outdoors, staying active, and trying new things. 
          I recently learned how to ski and have loved it! I also love all things dessert and am always down for a bowl of ice cream.
        </p>

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          My start-up idea is called Let's Talk Tacos. Provo is full of people looking for fun dates. 
          They want food, but not too expensive. 
          They want a sit down restaurant while still having a casual, fun atmosphere to talk and have fun. 
          Tacos check these boxes. They are simple, versatile, and loved by many. But how do you know which 
          taco restaurant to go to? There are so many options. Let's Talk Tacos is here to help. 
        </p>
        <p>This idea sparked from a simple date idea: try one taco from five different places and rank them. This website
          picks a random taco place within a specified mile radius to go and try. The website also displays 
          additional information, such as address, photos, and menu. You can then add the place to your list, 
          and generate another to try as well. After eating at the restuarant, the website prompts you to rank it 
          based on taste, atmosphere, and overall satisfaction. An easy, effective date idea for taco enthusiasts, 
          friends, and couples!
        </p>
        <p>
          My start-up idea is a website that can generate taco places for you to try in Provo. Check it out.
