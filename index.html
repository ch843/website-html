          Hi! I am from a small town about an hour west of Boston, Massachusetts. I am currently a Junior at BYU studying Information Systems.
          I enjoy spending time outdoors, staying active, and trying new things. I recently learned how to ski and have loved it! 
          I also love all things dessert and am always down for a bowl of ice cream. I am passionate, work hard, and enjoy solving problems.
          I'm always down for a good board game or puzzle.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          Provo is full of individuals looking for fun dates. They want food, but not too expensive. 
          They want a sit down restaurant while still having a casual, fun atmosphere to talk and have fun. 
          Tacos check these boxes. They are simple, versatile, and loved by many. But how do you know which 
          taco restaurant to go to? There are so many options. Let's Talk Tacos is here to help. This idea 
          sparked from a simple date idea: try one taco from five different places and rank them. This app 
          picks a random taco place within a specified mile radius to go and try. The app also displays 
          additional information, such as address, photos, and menu. You can then add the place to your list, 
          and generate another to try as well. After eating at the restuarant, the app prompts you to rank it 
          based on taste, atmosphere, and overall satisfaction. An easy, effective date idea for taco enthusiasts, 
          friends, and couples!
        </p>
        <p>
          My start-up idea is a website that can generate taco places for you to try in Provo. Check it out.
